description: AutoMathText is an extensive and carefully curated dataset encompassing around 200 GB of mathematical texts. It's a compilation sourced from a diverse range of platforms including various websites, arXiv, and GitHub (OpenWebMath, RedPajama, Algebraic Stack). This rich repository has been autonomously selected (labeled) by the state-of-the-art open-source language model, Qwen-72B. Each piece of content in the dataset is assigned a score lm_q1q2_score within the range of [0, 1], reflecting its relevance, quality and educational value in the context of mathematical intelligence.
