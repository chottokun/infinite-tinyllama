description: This dataset is comprised of emoji and emotion subsets of tweet_eval. The motivation is that the original emoji subset essentially contains only positive/neutral emojis, while emotion subset contains a varied array of emotions. So, the idea was to replace emotion labels with corresponding emojis (sad, angry) in the emotion subset and mix it together with the emoji subset.
