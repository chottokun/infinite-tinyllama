description: We present XLSum, a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 1.35 million professionally annotated article-summary pairs from BBC, extracted using a set of carefully designed heuristics. The dataset covers 45 languages ranging from low to high-resource, for many of which no public dataset is currently available. XL-Sum is highly abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic evaluation.
