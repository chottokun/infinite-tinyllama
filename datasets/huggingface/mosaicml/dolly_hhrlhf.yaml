description: This dataset is a combination of Databrick's dolly-15k dataset and a filtered subset of Anthropic's HH-RLHF. It also includes a test split, which was missing in the original dolly set. That test set is composed of 200 randomly selected samples from dolly + 4,929 of the test set samples from HH-RLHF which made it through the filtering process. The train set contains 59,310 samples; 15,014 - 200 = 14,814 from Dolly, and the remaining 44,496 from HH-RLHF.
